FILTER VERSIONS:
--------------------------

Regular = The normal version. Nice balance of hidden/shown items in the endgame. Perfect for beginners and experts alike.
Semi-Strict = Hides several bulky/bad rares. Designed for experienced players and speedrunners. Not recommended for beginners.
Strict = Hides the majority of all rares in the endgame. Designed for high-magic-find characters and cull-parties.
Slick = The regular version with less background colors (more GGG-styled). Also good for colorblind players.
Uber-Strict = Crazy filtering level. You've been warned. It displays only the Creme de la Creme. Hides >90% rares, portals, wisdoms, armorers, agumentations, most recipes etc.

Template = DO NOT USE FOR GAMEPLAY. Special version design for creating your own filters.

NOTE: The filter itself will always be free, including updates. There will NOT be premium/donator versions or options!
