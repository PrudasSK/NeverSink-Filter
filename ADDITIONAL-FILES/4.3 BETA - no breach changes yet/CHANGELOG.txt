NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.3 architecture overhaul
----------------------------------

Special thanks to GGG and Bex&Jonathan in specific for forwarding and answering my questions about the filtering algorithm. You guys rock!

NOTE:

- This is NOT the version for the PoE 2.5 update, this is a beta to confirm that the new filter parsing algorithm is working well (see below).
- The 2.5 version will be released on thursday or friday this week, but DEFINITLY before 2.5 is out (however, might be 2-3 hours before league start, as I'm working late this week)

STRUCTURE:

- Completely reworked the filter structure - based on the official information provided by GGG_Jonathan
- The new structure should be -significantly- faster. I suspect that the time needed to classify an endgame drop is 10 times smaller or even faster. This is a buff.
- Added a polished table of contents, that is auto-updated, thanks to a little C# tool.
- The filter syntax is a LOT more cleaner and commented now. The filter file has become a tiny bit larger, but this should not affect performance, since comments are not only parsed during the initial load (confirmed by GGG_Jonathan)
- Added comments and descriptions to every visual identifier: those are autoupdated, thanks to the same tool.
- The filter now supports alternative stylesheets (guess the tool). Those are located in folders called (STYLE) *stylename* and also have the 4 basic subversions (regular, semistrict, strict, uberstrict)
- The stylesheets are also kept up to date and provide the filter with a different appearance.
- For now only the "blue" stylesheet is added. More stylesheets coming soon.
- The new filter structure is easier to edit for users and easier to maintain for me
- Fixed several rare bugs

STYLE:

- Polished up the appearance of the filter thanks to the stylesheets. Removed or grouped similar colors, to provide a more uniform, polished appearance
- Implemented the new warband items. Identified boots and helmets of the ilvl 82 and sceptres, daggers and wands of the ilvl 84 will now appear with a special border
- Fix a few bugs.

PS: The raw alpha version of my FilterPolish tool can be found on: https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/Filterpolish-Release

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.24 minor update/bugfix
----------------------------------

- The uber-strict verison no longer hides vaal gems
- The semi-strict and other versions now correctly display flasks while leveling
- Readjusted the tier list a tiny bit
- Fixed a bug in the filterpolish tool - the version number is now incremented correctly

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.23 minor update/bugfix
----------------------------------

- The filter names now have a consistent name (no more version name in the file name) to enable better updating.
- Fixed certain chromatic sizes not being hidden in the stricted filters.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.22 minor update/bugfix
----------------------------------

- Fixed the T16 map background. I accidently removed it.
- Moved the judgement staff one tier down in the unique tier list

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.21 minor update
----------------------------------

- Adjusted the version-generator to remove alertsounds if the item is hidden.
- The royal burgonet is now the top-tier armor crafting base (GGG's helmets are confusing :D).
- Added dropsounds to the new crafting bases (>79 or >75 if rare) and increased their fontsize
- The dropsounds of lowlevel maps are a less loud

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.2 (for POE 2.4/atlas POLISHING UPDATE)
----------------------------------

**GENERAL** :

NOTE: The slick version is not updated in this version. Reason can be found below.

I've finally finished a small tool that auto-generates non-regular versions for me, allowing me to update easier, safer, introduce better filtering mechanics (as seen in this update) into the non-regular versions and potentially have more versions.

This update improves the filtering of the semi-strict/strict/UBERstrict a lotversions, reintroduces warband helmets markup (high level only, see below), adds a new block for highlighting selected 6S ilvl 84/83 items, slighlty improves the markup of maps and currency and fixes some bugs.

The next update will enable me to have easy stylesheet and color-table generations, I'll update the slick version, once it's done.

**Filterversions** :

- **Regular** - displays all rares
- **Semi-Strict** - hides all "*/bad rares" in the endgame and also all "clunky/ok" rares. Also hides clunky chromatic recipes, still shows gavels and a very small asortment of crafting trinkets (twostone, onyx, diamond)
- **Strict** - hides all non-good and even the good/2h items that are not top-tier. Recommended for large parties and heavy magic find characters. NOT recommended for beginners.
- **UBER-Strict** - [**NEW**] Crazy filtering level. You've been warned. It displays only the Creme de la Creme. Hides >90% rares, portals, wisdoms, armorers, agumentations, most recipes etc.
- **Slick** - same as regular, however less colors.

You can get more information and the filter itself:

Or you can get the filter directely from my GITHUB

If you want the notepad++ highlighting you can also find it on GITHUB

**NOTE:** Currently there exists a bug, that causes some fonts to appear weird ("empty boxes", distance between letters distant or wrong letters). This bug is caused by the POE engine itself and is not related to the filter (it can happen with other filters or even without them in other game parts too). If this happens to you: restart the game and it should be all gone. Please stop E-Mailing me about it, there's sadly nothing I can do, since this is client-related. GGG is aware of the bug.

----------------------------------
CHANGELOG:
----------------------------------

**CONTENT:**

- Added the UBER-strict version. You can find more details in the version description above.
- The code is now even more tidy, displays correctly in NotePad and is easier to keep up-to-date.
- Improved the filtering of the Semi-Strict version. It's a little bit more strict now
- Improved the filtering of the Strict version. It now differs between top tier and other items (the other items have no green backgrounds)
- The strict version now has a significantly smaller 83/84 crafting item list.
- Added Kris to the crafting lists
- Updated all versions to switch to non-leveling-mode at level 66. The dried lake is now a tiny bit cleaner. 
- Added 4 cards to the "trash-tier" divination cards (hermit, king's blade, prosperity, metalsmith's gift). They no longer give off sounds. I apologize if this upsets the creaters of those cards.
- Added new section that highlights selected ilvl 83/84 bases.
- Added a section for redblade warband helmets. To see them, you have to click alt/F (or whatever the key to display hidden items is for you). Magic helmets (ilvl 80+) will get highlighted in a red hue. Note that this affects ALL helmets, no matter who dropped them. Only use this when fighting redblade warbands (beacon map). If you want to enable other warbands you can do it in the code manually

**VISUAL:**

- Changed up some item-sizes (maps mostly to distinguish different map tiers better)
- Low maps have a weaker background
- Mid-High currency (chaos, vaal, regret, GCP, regal and some special ones) have a slightly more orangish hue on drop. -  I'm considering reintroducing the GONG sound on those, feedback welcome.

**SOUNDS:**

- Guardian map fragments don't give off the high-tier-item sound anymore (they still have the white background). The drop is expected and takes away a bit excitement.

**BUGFIXES:**

- This and that. I programmed 7 hours straight today and totally forgot what else I did o_O
