**FILTER VERSIONS:**

--------------------------

- **Regular** = The normal version. Nice balance of hidden/shown items in the endgame. Perfect for beginners and experts alike.
- **Slick** = The regular version with less background colors (more GGG-styled). Also good for colorblind players.
- **Semi-Strict** = Hides several bulky/bad rares. Designed for experienced players and speedrunners. Not recommended for beginners.
- **Strict** = Hides the majority of all rares in the endgame. Designed for high-magic-find characters and cull-parties.
- **Uber-Strict** = Crazy filtering level. It displays only the Creme de la Creme. Hides low orbs, low maps, most rares... You've been warned.

**NOTE:** The filter itself will always be free, including updates. There will never be any premium/donator versions or options!

**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

--------------------------

1) Download the latest filter from the "releases" section. 

2) Extract the files using WinRar/7zip or a similar tool.

3) Paste the .filter files (or just the folder content) into the following folder: *%userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile*

4) INGAME: Escape -> Options -> UI -> Scroll down -> Select one of the filters from the dropdown box.

I recommend using NotePad++ to edit the filter.
